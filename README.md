# JoystickPlugin :joystick:

This plugin uses SDL2 functions to pass input to the Unreal Engine Gameplay Input Loop.  
It provides a project friendly Force Feedback Effect library to enable Developers to create dynamic effects that are affected by gameplay.

Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/JaydenMaalouf/JoystickPlugin/wiki) for a guide on all things Joystick Plugin.

### What is the purpose of this plugin? :thought_balloon:

This plugin aims to provide a simple plug and play system for Joysticks and Steering Wheels (with Forced Feedback capabilities) for Unreal Engine 4/5.

### Features

- Native Unreal Input Loop :joystick:
- Event Driven Structure :mailbox_with_mail:
- Assign Controller to a player :video_game:
- Haptic/Force Feedback :collision:
- Sensor Data (Gyro/Accelerometer) :dancer:
- LED Control :rotating_light:

### How is this any different to the existing plugins? :thinking:

This plugin has been rebuilt (almost entirely) from it's forked version.  
It was designed with Unreal in mind, rather than a generic C++ plugin - making use of Subsystems, Project Settings and more!
The plugin is also multi-platform, supporting Linux and Windows distributions.

# :video_game: JoystickPlugin for Unreal Engine

**Plug in. Power up. Feel everything.**

`JoystickPlugin` brings SDL2-powered joystick and steering wheel support — including force feedback — to Unreal Engine 4 & 5. With a deep integration into Unreal’s Input System, this plugin is designed to help developers **create immersive, responsive, and reactive input experiences** with minimal setup.

## :bulb: Why use JoystickPlugin?

Unlike generic C++ wrappers, this plugin is **built for Unreal from the ground up**, taking full advantage of:

- :electric_plug: Subsystems
- :gear: Project Settings
- :jigsaw: Plugin Architecture

It's also **multi-platform**, with support for **Windows** and **Linux**!

## :sparkles: Key Features

- :video_game: **Native Unreal Input Loop** – Fully hooks into Unreal’s enhanced input system
- :mailbox_with_mail: **Event-Driven Architecture** – React to device input with clean, modular callbacks
- :bust_in_silhouette: **Player Controller Assignment** – Easily map devices to players
- :boom: **Force Feedback / Haptics** – Use gameplay events to trigger realistic FFB effects
- :satellite: **Sensor Data Support** – Read gyro and accelerometer values (where supported)
- :bulb: **LED Control** – Change device LEDs dynamically
- :card_index_dividers: **Device Profiles** – Define and load config presets for devices

---

## :thinking: How does it compare to other solutions?

JoystickPlugin isn't just a port — it's a full Unreal-native rework.  
Originally forked, this version was refactored with Unreal-first principles:

- :bricks: Uses UE Subsystems instead of ad-hoc architecture
- :hammer_and_wrench: Exposes plugin features in Project Settings for easy customization
- :earth_americas: Cross-platform (Windows/Linux) with minimal config

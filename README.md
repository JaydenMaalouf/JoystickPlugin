# JoystickPlugin

This plugin uses SDL2 functions to pass input to the Unreal Engine Gameplay Input Loop.  
It provides a project friendly Force Feedback Effect library to enable Developers to create dynamic effects that are affected by gameplay.

Visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/JaydenMaalouf/JoystickPlugin/wiki) for a guide on all things Joystick Plugin.

## What is the purpose of this plugin?

This plugin aims to provide a simple plug and play system for Joysticks and Steering Wheels (with Forced Feedback capabilities) for Unreal Engine 4 (support for 5.0EA coming soon).

## How is this any different to the existing plugins?

This plugin has been rebuilt (almost entirely) from it's forked version.  
It was designed with Unreal in mind, rather than a generic C++ plugin - making use of Subsystems, Project Settings and more!
